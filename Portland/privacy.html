    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Effective Date: April 16, 2025</p>

    <h2>1. Overview</h2>
    <p>MetroFeed is committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring transparency in how we handle any data associated with your visit. This policy outlines what limited information may be collected and how it is used. MetroFeed does not serve third-party advertising and does not track you across the web.</p>

    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>MetroFeed does not collect or store personal information such as names, emails, or account logins. Our analytics system may collect anonymized data, including browser type, device type, general location (city-level), time on page, and which pages are visited. All IP addresses are anonymized before processing.</p>

    <h2>3. Purpose of Data Use</h2>
    <p>We use anonymous traffic data to monitor performance, detect outages, evaluate which pages get the most use, and improve our overall design and responsiveness. Data is not used for targeting, profiling, or resold to any outside party.</p>

    <h2>4. Cookies</h2>
    <p>Cookies may be placed by Google Analytics to support basic performance tracking. These cookies do not store personally identifying data. You may opt out by disabling cookies in your browser settings. This may slightly impact how certain features behave.</p>

    <h2>5. Links to External Services</h2>
    <p>MetroFeed contains links to external services, such as transit agency websites, alert feeds, or weather maps. We are not responsible for the content or privacy practices of those third-party platforms. Use at your own discretion.</p>

    <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
    <p>MetroFeed does not operate user accounts, store sensitive data, or run a backend database. All analytics and cookie data is managed by Google under their privacy framework. No user-identifiable information is retained on our end. All reasonable steps are taken to prevent unauthorized access to any part of our system.</p>

    <h2>7. Youth Usage</h2>
    <p>MetroFeed is not intended for children under the age of 13. While we do not collect any personal data regardless of age, our content is designed for general public use and not specifically directed at minors. We encourage parents and guardians to monitor internet usage by minors.</p>

    <h2>8. Legal Compliance</h2>
    <p>MetroFeed aims to comply with applicable U.S. privacy regulations to the best of our ability. Users from jurisdictions with stricter privacy laws (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) are advised that MetroFeed does not offer personalized tracking or data processing, and any collected analytics data remains anonymous and is handled by Google.</p>

    <h2>9. Voluntary Communication</h2>
    <p>If you choose to contact MetroFeed (e.g., through our contact form or by email) or submit advertising material, you may voluntarily provide personal or business information such as your name, email address, or promotional content. This information is used solely to respond to your inquiry or coordinate advertising services. We do not share this information with third parties or use it for marketing purposes. Advertisers may request removal of their submitted information at any time.</p>

    <h2>10. Updates to This Policy</h2>
    <p>This policy may be revised at any time to reflect operational changes, compliance needs, or platform updates. Continued use of MetroFeed after any change constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.</p>

    <h2>11. Contact</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions, concerns, or requests related to this Privacy Policy, please <a href="contact.html">Contact Us</a>.</p>
